        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and kasha to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, 
                without stirring, until kasha groats are soft and fully open, 
                about 15 minutes. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking 
                sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Stir carrots, parsley, olive oil, basil, thyme, oregano, paprika, 
                mustard, and cayenne pepper into the kasha. Form mixture into 
                patties and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the outside, about 
                30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
